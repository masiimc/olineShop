ðŸ”—Live Demo :  https://masiimc.github.io/olineShop/

An online store using javascriptÙˆI used localstorag to store information,the data id static.

This online shop works in such a way that if you click on the add button, the item will be added to your shopping cart and the cost will be calculated. To change the number of items, go to the shopping cart or checkout page and change the number of your custom item. Every time you refresh the page, the changes you made on the page will remain.

There are two other options on the products, the add to favorites button and the single view mode button.
